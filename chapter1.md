# Usage

DBFlow supports a number of database features that will enhance and decrease time you need to spend coding with databases. We support multiple databases at the same time \(and in separate modules\) as long as there's no shared models.

What is covered in these docs are not all inclusive, but should give you an idea of how to operate with DBFlow on databases.

There are a few concepts to familiarize yourself with:

**SQLite Wrapper Language:** DBFlow provides a number of convenience methods, extensions, and generated helpers that produce a concise, flowable query syntax. A few examples below:

```
List<User> users = SQLite.select()
  .from(User.class)
  .where(name.is("Andrew Grosner"))
  .queryList();

SQLite.update(User.class)
  .set(name.eq("Andrew Grosner"))
  .where(name.eq("Andy Grosner"))
  .executeUpdateDelete()

FlowManager.getDatabase(AppDatabase.class).beginTransactionAsync((DatabaseWrapper wrapper) -> {
  // wraps in a SQLite transaction, do something on BG thread.
});

CursorResult<User> results = SQLite.select().from(User.class).queryResults();
for (User user: results) { // memory efficient iterator

}
```

Or in Kotlin:

    val users = (select from User::class where (name `is` "Andrew Grosner")).list

    (update<User>() set (name eq "Andrew Grosner") where (name eq "Andy Grosner")).executeUpdateDelete()

    database<AppDatabase>().beginTransactionAsync {

    }
