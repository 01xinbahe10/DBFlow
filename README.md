DBFlow
======

A robust, powerful, and very simple ORM android database library.

The library eliminates the need for writing SQL statements, writing ``ContentValues``` for every table, converting cursors into data, and so much more. 

Let DBFlow make SQL code _flow_ like a steady stream and allow you to focus on your problems, not be hindered by repetitive code writing.
