DBFlow
======

A robust, powerful, and very simple ORM android database library.

The library eliminates the need for writing most SQL statements, writing ``ContentValues`` for every table, converting cursors into models, and so much more. 

Let DBFlow make SQL code _flow_ like a _steady_ stream so you can focus on your complex problem and not be hindered by repetitive code writing. 

This library is based on both [Active Android](https://github.com/pardom/ActiveAndroid) and [Sprinkles](https://github.com/emilsjolander/sprinkles), but takes the **best** of both while offering much more functionality and extensibility. 

**Please** note that this is not in full release yet, and thus is in **Alpha**. Also the code is **not** fully guaranteed yet, meaning classes, methods, or even whole packages may not exist in further updates until the library becomes stable.

## Features:

### Efficiency
eliminates repetitive code, built to handle large DB operations, caching where needed

### Extensibility
customizable interfaces for many aspects of the library

### Power
SQL-lite query wrapping, **multiple database support**

### Ease
Migration handling

### Familiarity
Handling DB tables like a java ```List``` with the ```FlowTableList```

### Flexibility
Can use the SQL wrapping language, ```FlowCursorList```, or ```TransactionManager``` to perform DB operations. Each one serves a specific purpose.
