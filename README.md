DBFlow
======

A robust, powerful, and very simple ORM android database library.

The library eliminates the need for writing most SQL statements, writing ``ContentValues`` for every table, converting cursors into models, and so much more. 

Let DBFlow make SQL code _flow_ like a _steady_ stream so you can focus on your complex problem and not be hindered by repetitive code writing. 

This library is based on both [Active Android](https://github.com/pardom/ActiveAndroid) and [Sprinkles](https://github.com/emilsjolander/sprinkles), but takes the **best** of both while offering much more functionality and extensibility. 

**Please** note that this is not in full release yet, and thus is in **Alpha**.

## Features:

1. Loading and saving of Model objects. 
2. No need to define what Model classes to use - just implement the ```Model``` interface, extend ```BaseModel``` or extend ```BaseNotifiableModel``` .
3. Multiple primary key columns, handling complex foreign keys
4. Multi-database support fully baked in using the ```FlowManager```
5. Directly saving JSON to the database via ```JSONModel``` (with some minor caveats).
5. Database Views (Virtual tables)
6. Handling large amounts of database requests efficiently and effectively
7. Priority queuing of DB transactions through the ```DBTransactionQueue``` and the ```TransactionManager```
8. Migrations through both SQL files and inline code.
9. Complex queries wrapped in "builder" notation instead of using SQL strings.
10. ```TypeConverter``` that let **you** define how to store a particular class.
11. Powerful caching of reflection and repetitive queries to make this library _flow_ smoothly
12. And many more powerful features **baked** in.
