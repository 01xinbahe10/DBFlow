 * Description: The basic request object that's placed on the DBRequestQueue for processing.
 * The {@link com.grosner.dbflow.runtime.DBTransactionQueue} uses a priority queue that will process
 * this class based on the priority assigned to it.
 *
 * There are four main kinds of requests:
 *  For requests that require UI or immediate retrieval, use PRIORITY_UI
 *  For requests that are displayed in the UI some point in the near future, use PRIORITY_HIGH
 *  For the bulk of data requests, use PRIORITY_NORMAL
 *  For any request that's non-essential use PRIORITY_LOW
